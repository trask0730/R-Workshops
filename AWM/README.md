# Introduction to Coding in R
In this repository, you can find the R file from the "Introduction to Coding in R" workshop put on by Colorado State University's Association for Women in Mathematics student chapter. Ths title is titled "AWM-Coding.R".

In this workshop, we assume no coding background. Topics covered include:
* Accessing R and using RStudio
* Downloading packages
* Using R's built-in statistics package
* Coding basics, such as for loops and if statements
* Sample problems to try yourself

You may also find the csv file used in the workshop ("BlueSky2022") and solutions to the sample problems ("Solutions.R").
