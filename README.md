# Introduction to Coding in R
In this repository, you can find the R files from two "Introduction to Coding in R" workshops, one put on by Colorado State University's Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) student chapter as well as Colorado State Univerity's Data Science Seminar. You may also find csv files used in the workshops in the folder titled "Datasets".

In the Data Science Seminar workshop, we assume a basic familiary with programming. We discuss:
* Accessing R and using RStudio
* Downloading packages
* Using R's built-in statistics package
* Plotting with ggplot2
  

In the AWM workshop, we assume no coding background. Topics covered include:
* Accessing R and using RStudio
* Downloading packages
* Using R's built-in statistics package
* Coding basics, such as for loops and if statements
* Sample problems to try yourself
